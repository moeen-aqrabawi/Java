/* 
 * Exercise 9.1 : (The Rectangle Class) Following the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2
 * design a class named Rectangle to represent rectangle. The class contains:
 * - Two double data fields named width and height that specify the width and height of the rectangle. the default values are 1 for both.
 * - A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle 
 * - A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height
 * - A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle
 * - A method named getPerimeter() that returns perimeter
 * 
 * Write a test program that creates two Rectangle objects - one with width 4 and height 40  
 * and the other with width 3.5 and height 35.9. Display the width and height, area and permiter of each rectangle in this order.
