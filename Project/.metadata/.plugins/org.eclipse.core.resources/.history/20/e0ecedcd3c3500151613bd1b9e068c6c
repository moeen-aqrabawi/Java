/*
 * Exercise 11.1
 * (The Triangle class) Design a class named Triangle that extends GeometricObject. The class contains:
 * 
 - Three double data fields named side1, side2, and side3 with default values 1.0 to denote three sides of the triangle
 - A no-arg constructor that creates a triangle.
 - A constructor that creates a triangle with the specific side1, side2,and side3.
 - The accessor methods for all three data fields.
 - A method named getArea() that returns the area if this triangle.
 - A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of this triangle.
 - A method named toString() that returns a string description for the triangle.

For the formula to compute the area of a triangle, see ProgrammingExercise 2.19.
The toString() method is implemented as follows:

return " Triangle: side1 = " + side1 + " side2 = " + side2 + " side3 " + side3;

Draw the UML diagrams for the classes Triangle and GeometricObject and 
implement the classes. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter three
sides of the triangle, a color, and a boolean value to indicate wheter the triangle
is filled. The program should create a triangle object with these sides and set 
the color and filled properties using the input. The program should display 
the area, perimeter, color and true or false to indicate whether it is filled or not.
